<h1 id="a-bit-about-mic">A bit about Mic</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a web developer for about 5-6 years now. I started as a PHP develop straight out of college working on a large legacy codebase for a company working in facilities management. After this I decided to focus on front end development finding a focus more in the way of javascript development. More recently I have been expanding my horizons into learning golang.</p>

<p>Anything of the content on this site are my own and do not represent the views of the company I currently work for or any in the past. Just thought I&rsquo;d get that out the way even though it should be an obvious fact these days&hellip;</p>

<p>For reference here&rsquo;s my LinkedIn blurb!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working as a front-end developer at Lush using current web technologies and tools.</p>

<p>A good team player who is always willing to help, and is also confident in working by himself. Is a friendly, honest, and reliable person who interacts well with others. Throughout college and current employment has developed an organised and flexible approach to work.</p>
