      <description>Here begins my first weekly resource post! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep doing these regularly but who knows how long I&amp;rsquo;ll keep them up! This week will be a dump of stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve found from the past few weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed a few books I&amp;rsquo;ve read/am reading and some language learning resources etc.
Articles I liked and thought were worth a read  Spend 5 hours a week learning You don&amp;rsquo;t understand your software engineers Why should you learn Go?</description>
