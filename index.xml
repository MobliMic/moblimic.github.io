      <description>A bit about Mic I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a web developer for about 5-6 years now. I started as a PHP develop straight out of college working on a large legacy codebase for a company working in facilities management. After this I decided to focus on front end development finding a focus more in the way of javascript development. More recently I have been expanding my horizons into learning golang.</description>
