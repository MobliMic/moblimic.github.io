      <description>This resource post is very late and very thin on the ground this week! I was at a conference over the weekend so here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the youtube playlist of the videos. There will be some content worth watching in there! I&amp;rsquo;d recommend watching the talk on Empathy-Driven Development when it gets uploaded.
JSConfEU 2018 YouTube playlist
Also here are some links
 Testing for non-testers WCAG 2.1 was published this week  You can find all the weekly resource posts here</description>

      <description>Here begins my first weekly resource post! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep doing these regularly but who knows how long I&amp;rsquo;ll keep them up! This week will be a dump of stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve found from the past few weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed a few books I&amp;rsquo;ve read/am reading and some language learning resources etc.
Articles I liked and thought were worth a read  Spend 5 hours a week learning You don&amp;rsquo;t understand your software engineers Why should you learn Go?</description>

      <description>So this is the beginning of my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to start something for an absolute age now and never really knew what I would write about or the tone I wanted to go for. Instead of spending months toiling over what I want to write or whether or not I can write something of value I decided to say fuck it and just do what I want.
Most of my content will be focused on tech-related stuff.</description>
